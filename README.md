A collection of codes from my undergraduate(Carleton College) and high school studies and personal projects.
* **CS201 Data structure (Java)**
   - contains Java codes from assignments in CS201(fall 2022), including the implementation of different sorting algorithms.
* **CS251 Programming Languages (Scheme, C)**
   - contains Scheme codes from assignments in CS251, winter 2022.
* **CS257 Software Design (Python, HTML, CSS, SQL)**
   - contains production codes and tests for a Chick-fil-A nutritional info website that is in the development process by three teammates in the class and I.
* **CS321 Making Decision With AI (Python, Prolog)**
   - contains Python and Prolog codes for the assignment of this class. Topics include searching algorithms, minimax, propositional logic, and reinforcement learning.
* **Hackability Project (Python)**
   -A hackability(hacking disability) project I made when I was in high school. The device can identify  pedestrian traffic light colors and provide sound feedback for people with visual disabilities. I used a RaspberryPi to do the project, and this folder contains the code for this prototype.
* **Interactive Art Installation: The Living Funeral**
   -Hosts the code and photo for 'The Living Funeral', an interactive piece designed in Fall 2023 to invoke contemplation on life's impermanence. It features a Python-driven interface with user interactions, Arduino and Raspberry Pi for responsive elements, and integrates audiovisual feedback to craft an immersive experience.
* **Leetcode Solutions (C++, Java)**
  - contains solutions for LeetCode problems I completed in my freshman and sophomore year.
  - File naming mostly follows the format: Problem_name_Problem_ID.
* **Scheme_Interpreter_CS251 (C)**
  - a Scheme Interpreter in C built by Duc and me for CS251 Programming Languages in the winter of 2022.
