#### Possible ways of user interaction with data:

**1. Allergen Alert:**

Users input in advance specific allergens they need to avoid (e.g., gluten, dairy, egg). Our project will offer recommendations of food and drinks to our users according to that list.

**2. Custom Meal Suggestion:**

Users of our website can customize their meals and receive the nutrition information based on their selections. Our website can also generate a list of food suggestions based on users' preference (e.g low-fat/ 1 salad + 1 drink/ gluten-free).

**3. Personalized Nutritional Tracker:**

Our website will be able to provide scientific and healthy meal suggestions to the users, based on their personal interest and health condition. This could be particularly helpful for people with dietary restrictions or for those trying to optimize their meals for certain health goals. Over time, the tool could track and visualize a user's nutritional intake, comparing it against recommended daily values.

## Team Contract

### Goals Statement:

1. Foster an environment where every team member feels valued, heard, and motivated to contribute actively.

2. Complete the project on time with satisfactory quality and equal workload for everyone in the group.

### Strengths of our team and its members:

Team: We know each other pretty well, and we can collaborate on the project efficiently.

Charlie: My coding skill is strong and I am good at time management.

Hank: I have previous software/code project experience, so I am willing to coordinate the work between group members to make the process more efficient.

Lee: I have good debugging skills and creativity.

Austin: I have effective searching skills and good will of coordination.

### Ways to capitalize on the strengths of each member:

We will designate specific roles to make our meetings more structured and run more smoothly. However, since the exact work for the project is unknown at this point, we will assign specific roles for project work (which will possibly rotate) when it actually starts. We will rotate roles so that everyone can have experience of different roles for software development.

### Meeting time and location:

We will meet twice a week, two hours each, normally on Wednesdays and Sundays afternoons in Olin CS lab.

### Roles and responsibilities (in meetings & discussions):

Charlie: setting agendas, contact with team members

Hank: facilitate discussion

Lee: note-taking, summarizing a to-do list for after the meeting

Austin: manage and look up all the code base/ database for reference in meeting

### Roles and responsibilities (for specific features):

Charlie and Lee: mainly responsible for creating features that look up food calories by name and return a list of food based on specific dietary restrictions.

Austin and Hank: mainly responsible for creating features that return all the allergies given a list of food, and new features that we might have along the way.

### Primary communication method:

We will communicate with each other via email(sharing work) and WhatsApp (setting up meetings and brief updates on current progress). All version control of code files will be managed via git and GitHub with well-written comments.

### Tips for respectful communication:

1. Criticize ideas but not the person.
2. Listen respectfully and actively while another team member is talking.
3. Stay calm.
4. Use constructive criticism.
5. No backseat driving.

### Rules for communication (frequency and consequences)

Team members need to check group chat, email twice a day and reply to questions from other group members within 24 hours. If there’s a team member who hasn’t been communicating, the other team members are responsible for calling that team member on the phone to check in and ask for active engagement.  If the team member refuses to actively participate or communicate, the situation will be discussed with the professor.

### Usage of technology:

We will primarily use github team repo  for managing our code files and other documents. Since we plan on in-person meetings, no other technologies are planned to be needed. In case of unlikely situations such as covid isolations, we might switch to Zoom for online meetings.

### Decision making:

Technical decisions will be made by the member in charge of that branch of work and decisions about directions will be made by a majority rule.

### Teamwork style:

We divide our work based on the overall goals for a given week. We will aim for each member to get the same amount of workload. When we are working in labs, we will divide into 2 subgroups, where members in each subgroup rotate between “driver”, writing the code, and “inspector”, checking the work and giving suggestions. 

### Participation & Conflict resolution strategies:

We will have clear expectations for team members’ roles and responsibilities. Team members should follow the code of conduct for communication. Team members are expected to create respectful and inclusive environments, but this doesn’t mean valid concerns can’t be raised in discussion. In addition, this means concerns from team members should be taken with understanding.

### Expectations for team members:

We expect group members to spend at least 5 hours per week outside the course.

### Consequences of violating team contract:

We give a warning for the first time and email Anya if it happens repeatedly (more than 2 times).
